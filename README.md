# Data-Science

This repository contains a collection of data science experiments and projects that I (Azan Wasty) have worked on. The focus is on exploring various machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques using real-world datasets. The primary language used is Jupyter Notebook, with some supporting scripts in Python.

## Contents

- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
  - `BayesSpamPredictionModel.ipynb`: Implements a Naive Bayes classifier to predict spam messages.
  - `DBSCAN.ipynb`: Demonstrates the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.
  - `DiabeticPatientAnalysis.ipynb`: Data analysis and modeling for diabetic patient datasets.
  - `K-Means.ipynb`: Explores the K-Means clustering technique.
  - `KNNs.ipynb`: K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm application and analysis.
  - `LifeExpectancyAnalysis.ipynb`: Analyzes life expectancy factors using a provided dataset.
  - `LinearRegression.ipynb`: Linear regression modeling and interpretation.
  - `ModelEvaluations.ipynb`: Evaluates machine learning models and metrics.
  - `NN_imageProcessing.ipynb`: Application of neural networks on image data.
  - `NeuralNetworks.ipynb`: Basic neural networks implementations and experiments.
  - `TitanicDataset_knn.ipynb`: KNN analysis on the Titanic dataset.

- **Python Scripts:**
  - `PlayerPerformanceAnalysis.py`: Analyzes football player performance.

- **Datasets:**
  - `K-Means.csv`, `KNNs.csv`, `Life_Expectancy_Data.csv`, `LinearRegression.csv`, `Titanic-Dataset.csv`, `cancer.csv`, `diabetes.csv`, `eafc.csv`, `iris.csv`, `spambase.data`: Datasets used for training, testing, and demonstration.
  
- **Other Files:**
  - `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`: Repository configuration files.
  - `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azan-wasty/Data-Science.git
   ```
2. Open any Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Install necessary dependencies (most notebooks use commonly available libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc.).

4. Run the notebooks/codes as per your exploration needs.

## Purpose

The repository aims to:

- Explore and compare popular machine learning algorithms (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
- Analyze datasets from healthcare, education, sports, and more.
- Serve as a playground for learning and experimenting with various data science concepts.

## License

Currently, no license is specified for this project.
